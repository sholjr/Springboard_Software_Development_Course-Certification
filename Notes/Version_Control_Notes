What is Version Control? 
A system that allows for editing of mutiple revisions of the same unit of information

VSA allows mutiple actors to cooperate and share files

Why is VCS useful 
* It enforces discipline 
* It archives versions of information
* It hosts a history of information of prior versions
* Allows for a simple an easy way for many to collaberate. 
* Recovers prior accidental mistake that can "break code" or if something is accidentally deleted. 
* Conserves system workspace / data

The Evolution of Version Control Systems (VCS)

50's & 60's
Program source code was written on punch cards so programs where not shared between others at this time, the "Source code control system" was simply your desk drawer

Early 70's 
Programmers starting to work on a modularization of source code. 
They would use phyiscal bulletin boards to monitor source control codes of there different modules

Late 70's
With the growth of text editors and disk drives, programmers wanted more control over revision history of their source code
SCCS (Souce Code Control System) is a version control system that was designed to track changes in source code or other text files while a piece of software was still in development.
SCCS was developed by Bell labs in 1972 by Marc Rochkind
The first public release of SCCS was version 4 and it was launched on Feburary 18th, 1977

The 80's
Revision Control System (RCS) stored a set of edit instructions that would go back to an earlier version of a file or program
RCS was released in 1982 by Walter F. Tichy.
