Javascript Fundamentals Hand out --> https://lessons.springboard.com/JS-Fundamentals-d6b58513d68a426f9a474f0cc09c0398#3d49b22da82a46f98f7c7ea6f8040caf


====================================================


JS Building Blocks
    Values & Variables

Goals 
 Working with primitive types
    * Number
    * String
    * Boolean
    * Null
    * Undefined

 Understand let & const

 Use String Template Literals

 Work with common operators / methods

 To make comments use `//`

====================================================

Primitive Types
    * Number
       Numeraic Value
    * String
       Text in quotation marks
    * Boolean
       True or False values
    * Null
    * Undefined
    * Symbol
    * BigInt
       
Primitive Type -> Numbers
   A way of storing or repersenting a number in Javascript.
   Number function allows 
      Postive,
      Negitive,
      Whole (intergers)
      & Decimal Numbers
   
   Opperators
      Additon, (+)
      Subtraction, (-)
      Division, (-)
      Mutiplaction, (*)
      Modulo, (%)
      Exponents, (**)

   N a N ( Not  A Number)
    0/0 = NaN
    1 + NaN = NaN
   
Variables & let
   Variables  act like a labeled jar
     Stores a value and a name so you can;
        * Recall it
        * Use it
        * Change it later   
           
   Basic Syntax // let someName = 'value';

   To Update Value(s)
     [ 'someName' + 'someName' = 'Value' ]

   shorthand version
     [ 'someName' += 'Value' ] 
   
   Can not use Variables with lexically bound names or declared identifiers
      Use detailed  names rather than simple characters
   You can not start a Variables with a numerical digit

   Camocase -> When naming this with many words don't capitalize first word but capitalize words that come after the first 
      Ex ( let someName or let someBodyIUseToKnow )

Unary Variables

   (++) will add 1 to Variables
   (--) Will deduct 1 from Variables

Constant
   Basic Syntax
      (const 'someName' = 4)

   const works like let except you can not change the value

VAR 
   Prior to let and const var was the only way to declare a Variable. 

   Example Syntax
      ( var eggs = 12)
   ** slight difference between var and let, not mentioned yet but has to do with scope*

Booleans
   True or False values

Strings
   Values that use Text
   Must use either ' or " and wrap text But you can't mix and match

   Strings are indexed, meaning that each character has a positional number The first character of a string will always be at position '0' and will count up from 0 
      [ For Ex. "Chicken" = '0123456' ]

   Strings have a 'length' property that will count characters
      [ "hello".length =an output '5' ]
   
   Putting brackets around index will call for the repersenting postion's character
      { hello [3] = 'l' }

   Strings are immudable and can not be changed

   Some string methods accept arguments that modify the string's behavior. These arguments should be inside (parentheses)

      Explaining stringMethod.indexOf using example string [ let tvShow = 'catdog' ;]
         tvShow.indexOf('cat') will result in 0
         tvShow.indexOf('dog') will result in 3
         tvShow.indexOf ('z')  will result in -1 (not found)

            This method search for which value the search starts at. for example 'cat' is the start of the sting. And 'dog' starts at 3 because thats when it falls in the index.

               If there are more than one letter or reference you will get the first character found

               If there is no value found in the search it will result in -1 

      Explaining stringMethod.slice using example string [ let str = 'supercalifragilisticeexpialidocious'] 
         str.slice(0,5); will result in 'super'
         str.slice(5);   will result in 'califragilisticexpialidocious'

   REPL
      R read
      E evaluate
      P print
      L loop
         
   use [ console.log() ] 
         
   String Escapes
      \n - * Newline   
      \' - * Single quote
      \" - * Double Quote
      \\ - * Backslash
   
      Example of double Quote
         "He said \"I ain't happy\""
            Results in [ He said "I ain't happy" ]
               Using the Backslash {\} before the quote tells Javascript that the quotes after the Backslash are apart of the string, not the end of a string. The same applies for Single quotes. 
   
      Example,  
         'Jacob isn\'t happy'
            Results in [ Jacob isn't happy ]
   
   String Template Literals
      Template literals are strings that allow embedded expressions. The expressions will be evaluated and turned into a proper string. 
      
      Must use the back-tick in order to Template literals (`)

         Example [ `I counted ${3 + 4} sheep` // will result in "I countd 7 sheep ]
   
            Further Examples
               let item      = 'cucumbers';
               let price     = 1.99;
               let quantity  = 4;
                  `You bought ${quantity} ${item}, Total Price: $${price*quantity}`;
                     // Results in [ "You bought 4 cucumbers, Total Price: $7.96" ]
   
               const minAge =21;
               let yourAge  =19;
                  `You must be ${minAge} to enter. Come back in ${minAge - yourAge} years!`
                     // Results in [ "You mustt be 21 to enter. Come back in 2 years!" ]
