====================================================


JS Building Blocks
    Values & Variables

Goals 
 Working with primitive types
    * Number
    * String
    * Boolean
    * Null
    * Undefined

 Understand let & const

 Use String Template Literals

 Work with common operators / methods

 To make comments use `//`

====================================================

Primitive Types
    * Number
       Numeraic Value
    * String
       Text in quotation marks
    * Boolean
       True or False values
    * Null
    * Undefined
    * Symbol
    * BigInt
       
Primitive Type -> Numbers
   A way of storing or repersenting a number in Javascript.
   Number function allows 
      Postive,
      Negitive,
      Whole (intergers)
      & Decimal Numbers
   
   Opperators
      Additon, (+)
      Subtraction, (-)
      Division, (-)
      Mutiplaction, (*)
      Modulo, (%)
      Exponents, (**)

   N a N ( Not  A Number)
    0/0 = NaN
    1 + NaN = NaN
   
Variables & let
   Variables  act like a labeled jar
     Stores a value and a name so you can;
        * Recall it
        * Use it
        * Change it later   
           
   Basic Syntax // let someName = 'value';

   To Update Value(s)
     [ 'someName' + 'someName' = 'Value' ]

   shorthand version
     [ 'someName' += 'Value' ] 
   
   Can not use Variables with lexically bound names or declared identifiers
      Use detailed  names rather than simple characters
   You can not start a Variables with a numerical digit

   Camocase -> When naming this with many words don't capitalize first word but capitalize words that come after the first 
      Ex ( let someName or let someBodyIUseToKnow )

Unary Variables

   (++) will add 1 to Variables
   (--) Will deduct 1 from Variables

Constant
   Basic Syntax
      (const 'someName' = 4)

   const works like let except you can not change the value

VAR 
   Prior to let and const var was the only way to declare a Variable. 

   Example Syntax
      ( var eggs = 12)
   ** slight difference between var and let, not mentioned yet but has to do with scope*

Booleans
   True or False values
