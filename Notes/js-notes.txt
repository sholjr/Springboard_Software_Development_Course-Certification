====================================================


JS Building Blocks
    Values & Variables

Goals 
 Working with primitive types
    * Number
    * String
    * Boolean
    * Null
    * Undefined

 Understand let & const

 Use String Template Literals

 Work with common operators / methods

 To make comments use `//`

====================================================

Primitive Types
    * Number
       Numeraic Value
    * String
       Text in quotation marks
    * Boolean
       True or False values
    * Null
    * Undefined
    * Symbol
    * BigInt
       
Primitive Type -> Numbers
   A way of storing or repersenting a number in Javascript.
   Number function allows 
      Postive,
      Negitive,
      Whole (intergers)
      & Decimal Numbers
   
   Opperators
      Additon, (+)
      Subtraction, (-)
      Division, (-)
      Mutiplaction, (*)
      Modulo, (%)
      Exponents, (**)

   N a N ( Not  A Number)
    0/0 = NaN
    1 + NaN = NaN
   
Variables & let
   Variables  act like a labeled jar
     Stores a value and a name so you can;
        * Recall it
        * Use it
        * Change it later   
           
   Basic Syntax // let someName = 'value';

   To Update Value(s)
     [ 'someName' + 'someName' = 'Value' ]

   shorthand version
     [ 'someName' += 'Value' ] 
   
   Can not use Variables with lexically bound names or declared identifiers
      Use detailed  names rather than simple characters
   You can not start a Variables with a numerical digit

   Camocase -> When naming this with many words don't capitalize first word but capitalize words that come after the first 
      Ex ( let someName or let someBodyIUseToKnow )

   Unary Variables

      (++) will add 1 to Variables
      (--) Will deduct 1 from Variables

Constant
   Basic Syntax
      (const 'someName' = 4)

   const works like let except you can not change the value

VAR 
   Prior to let and const var was the only way to declare a Variable. 

   Example Syntax
      ( var eggs = 12)
   ** slight difference between var and let, not mentioned yet but has to do with scope*

Booleans
   True or False values

Strings
   Values that use Text
   Must use either ' or " and wrap text But you can't mix and match

   Strings are indexed, meaning that each character has a positional number The first character of a string will always be at position '0' and will count up from 0 
      [ For Ex. "Chicken" = '0123456' ]

   Strings have a 'length' property that will count characters
      [ "hello".length =an output '5' ]
   
   Putting brackets around index will call for the repersenting postion's character
      { hello [3] = 'l' }

   Strings are immudable and can not be changed

   Some string methods accept arguments that modify the string's behavior. These arguments should be inside (parentheses)

      Explaining stringMethod.indexOf using example string [ let tvShow = 'catdog' ;]
         tvShow.indexOf('cat') will result in 0
         tvShow.indexOf('dog') will result in 3
         tvShow.indexOf ('z')  will result in -1 (not found)

            This method search for which value the search starts at. for example 'cat' is the start of the sting. And 'dog' starts at 3 because thats when it falls in the index.

               If there are more than one letter or reference you will get the first character found

               If there is no value found in the search it will result in -1 

      Explaining stringMethod.slice using example string [ let str = 'supercalifragilisticeexpialidocious'] 
         str.slice(0,5); will result in 'super'
         str.slice(5);   will result in 'califragilisticexpialidocious'

   REPL
      R read
      E evaluate
      P print
      L loop
         
   use [ console.log() ] 
         
   String Escapes
      \n - * Newline   
      \' - * Single quote
      \" - * Double Quote
      \\ - * Backslash
   
      Example of double Quote
         "He said \"I ain't happy\""
            Results in [ He said "I ain't happy" ]
               Using the Backslash {\} before the quote tells Javascript that the quotes after the Backslash are apart of the string, not the end of a string. The same applies for Single quotes. 
   
      Example,  
         'Jacob isn\'t happy'
            Results in [ Jacob isn't happy ]
   
   String Template Literals
      Template literals are strings that allow embedded expressions. The expressions will be evaluated and turned into a proper string. 
      
      Must use the back-tick in order to Template literals (`)

         Example [ `I counted ${3 + 4} sheep` // will result in "I countd 7 sheep ]
   
            Further Examples
               let item      = 'cucumbers';
               let price     = 1.99;
               let quantity  = 4;
                  `You bought ${quantity} ${item}, Total Price: $${price*quantity}`;
                     // Results in [ "You bought 4 cucumbers, Total Price: $7.96" ]
   
               const minAge =21;
               let yourAge  =19;
                  `You must be ${minAge} to enter. Come back in ${minAge - yourAge} years!`
                     // Results in [ "You mustt be 21 to enter. Come back in 2 years!" ]

Null
   Intentional absence of any value
   Must be Assigned
      Example [ let loggedInUser = null; ]
         This tells Javascript that the value is nothing  / not assigned yet

Undefined
   Variables that do not have an Assigned value and are Undefined

Math Object 
   Contains properties and methods for mathmatical constants and functions
      // Examples of math objects
         Pi 
            Math.PI             // 3.141592653589793

         Rounding a number
            Math.round(4.9)     //5

         Absolute Values
            Math.abs(-456)      //456

         Raises # to the #'s power
            Math.pow(2,5)       //32

         Removes Decimal
            Math.floor(3.99999) //3

   Random Numbers
      Math.random()  gives us a random Decimal between 0 and 1 (non-inclusive)

         Example of Math.random

            const step1 = Math.random();
               //0.561104892810127

            const step2 = step1 * 10
               //5.561104892810127
            
            const step 3 = Math.floor(step2);
               //5
            
            const step 4 = step3 + 1;
               //6

         Shorthand Example
            [ Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1 ]
               //6

parseInt & parseFloat

   Turns strings into numbers. (can cause NaN errors)
      Examples
         parseInt('24')          //24
         parseInt('24.987')      //24
         parseInt('28dayslater') //28   
   
         parseFloat('24.987')          //24.987
         parseFloat('7')               //7
         parseFloat('I ate 3 shrimp)   //NaN

      Returns NaN if there is a character prior to a number

Conditional Logic
   Goals
      * Understand Comparison Operators
      * Write Conditionals
      * Work with Boolean Operators


   Comparison Operators [ Defults to returning a Boolean ]

         >   // Greater than 
         <   // Less than
         >=  // Greater than or equal to
         <=  // Less than or equal to 

         ==  // equalality
         !=  // Not equal
         === // Strict Equality
         !== // Strict non-equalality

   Most Comparisons are made to compare numbers, however, You can compare strings. When using special characters, accents, and cases they can get "dicey".
   When comparing strings 'Unicode' identifiers will determine strings Comparisons

   == vs === ( Equality vs Strict Equality)

      == ( Double Equals )
         Checks equalality of a value, but not equalality of types
         It coerces both values to the same type and then compares them
         May lead to unexpected Results
      
      === ( Triple Equals )
         Checks for both values and types

      != is the same has ==     But    it checks if the values are not the same

      !== is the same has ===   But    it checks if values & types are not the same

   Conditional Statements 
      There are 3 types of conditionals statements
         IF
         ELSE IF
         ELSE

      IF
         Runs designated code if a condition is marked as 'TRUE' 

      ELSE IF
          A follow up condition if the first 'IF' condtion was not met. 

      ELSE
         Runs if there 'IF' and 'ELSE IF' did not return a value. 
         Does not need a conditional argument.  Requires an 'IF' statement, but not an 'ELSE IF'

   Nesting
      Nesting is the stacking of several layers of conditionals in a given statement.

   Truthy & Falsy Values
      All values have an inherent truthy or falsy boolean value
         Values considered 'Falsy'
            * False
            * 0
            * "" (Empty string)
            * Null
            * Undefined
            * NaN
         All other values are considered truthy

   Logical Operators
      List of Logical Operators
         * &&   And 
                     compares values has true and if both sides are not true then it will return has false

         * ||   OR
                  compares if one side is true or false, if one side is the same it is returned has true

         * !   NOT
                  Returns 'TRUE' if the given value is considered 'FALSE'

   Operators Precident
      Precident Ranking
         NOT (!)   has a higher precedence than && and ||
         &&  (AND) has a higher precedence than ||
         ||  (OR)  has the lowest precedence

      Logic Example
         ``` let x = 7
             x==7 || x===3 && x > 10;```
               Result : 'TRUE'
         Reason:
            Sense the (&&) Operators has precedence over the (||) operator the script runs (&&) first. 
            (x === 3 && x > 10) x == 7

   Switch Value Example 
      ``` switch  (day) { 
         case1:
            console.log("Monday");
         case2:
            console.log("Tuesday");
         case3:
            console.log("Wednesday");
         case4:
            console.log("Thursday");
         case5:
            console.log("Friday");
         case6:
            console.log("Saturday");
         case7:
            console.log("Sunday");
      } ```

      Adding a 'break;' to the will run only the case(#) that the script is looking for
         
         ``` switch  (day) { 
            case1:
               console.log("Monday");
                  break;
            case2:
               console.log("Tuesday");
                  break;
            case3:
               console.log("Wednesday");
                  break;
            case4:
               console.log("Thursday");
                  break;
            case5:
               console.log("Friday");
                  break;
            case6:
               console.log("Saturday");
                  break;
            case7:
               console.log("Sunday");
                  break;
         } ```

Ternary Operator
   Is a "shortcut index" it takes an 'IF' and an 'ELSE' and making them a single line of code
   
   Follows (3) arguments [ condition ? expIfTrue: expIfFalse ]
      Example
         let num  =7;
      
         if(num === 7) {
            console.log("lucky!")
         }
         else {
            console.log("BAD!");
         }
      Example w/ Ternary shorthand
         num === 7 ? console.log("lucky"): console.log("BAD!");

      Example using Variable
         let status = 'offline';
         let color;
            if (status === 'offline') {
               color ='red';
            }
            else {
               color = 'green';
            }
      Variable Example w/ shorthand
          let color = status ==='offline' ? ''red' : 'green';


Arrays - Collections of Data
   Goals 
      * Work with Arrays
      * Write Object Literals
      * Understand reference types
      * Use common Array/Object methods

   Arrays
      Ordered collections of values
         Common Examples
            * List of comments on an social media postion
            * Collection of levels in a game
            * Songs in a playlist

      Making an Array
         let newArray = [1,2,3]
         let newStringArray = ['Milk','Eggs','Bacon']

   Array Indices
      Arrays have a corresponding index 
         Example
            let colors = ['red', 'orange', 'yellow', 'green', 'blue', 'indigo', 'violet' ]; 
               colors[0] //red
               colors[1] //orange
               colors[2] //yellow
               colors[3] //green
               colors[4] //blue
               colors[5] //indigo
               colors[6] //violet
            
      Modifing Arrays
         Arrays are mutiable so we can modify and change them.
         You can change an array by accessing it's index value [#]

            Array Modification Syntax
               (Example Array)
                  let shoppingList = ['Milk', 'eggs', 'bacon']
            
            (Array Update Example)
               shoppingList[0] = 'Skim Milk';
               shoppingList[1] = 'Pasture-raised Eggs';
               shoppingList[2] = 'Thin-cut bacon'

            Push
               Adds an element to an array at the end the array.

                  Example of Push
                     shoppingList.push('Butter', 'Pancake Mix')
                        // shoppingList 
                           Skim Milk
                           Pasture-raised Eggs
                           Thin-cut bacon
                           Butter
                           Pancake-mix
            
            Pop
               Takes a value from the end of an array and will return to the user.
                  shoppingList Example
                     shoppingList.pop() // Pancake.mix
               Removes what the "Popped" Variable was. If you pop an entire array it will start to return "Undefined"

            Unshift
               Removes elements from the start of an array. Returns the start of an array
                  Example Array
                     let dishesToDo = ['Big Platter']
                        dishesToDo.unshift('Large Plate')
                        dishesToDo.unshift('Small Plate')
            
            Shift
               Removes the first element from an array and returns that removed element.
            
            More methods
               concat() Merges two or more arrays into a new merged Array
                  Syntax : array1.concat(array2);
                     let concat = array1(array2, array3)
                        //concat = array1, array2, array3
               The order of arrays are passed as arguments that determines the order of the concatenated array

            Includes
               Includes looks for a value, it's a boolean (TRUE or FALSE) element 
               Internet Explorer does not support .Include
               Looks for (1:1) match in an array
                  shoppingList.Includes('Butter')  //true
                     shoppingList.includes('Eggs') //false

               Syntax: if(shoppingList.includes('Skim Milk')) {
                  console.log('I am lactose intolerant I will get sick)
               }

               indexOf
                  Works like the strings version of .indexOf when looking for  a value
                     shoppingList.indexOf('Skim Milk) // 0 

                  Reverse
                     Syntax Example
                        Let letters = [ 'A','B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'G']
                           letters.reverse // G, E, D, C, B, A
                     Running array in reverse will mutilate the array and change it.

                  Join
                     Creates and returns a new string by concatenating all elemments in an array, seperated by commas or specified seperator strings
                        Example
                           let elements = [
                              'fire',
                              'Air',
                              'Water',
                           ];

                        console.log(elements.join{});
                           //"Fire,Air,Water"
                     If joining non-string elements, It will create and return a string

                  slice
                     It takes a portion of an array and allows you to copy and return the array into a new array
                        Example
                           let animals = [
                              'shark',
                              'salmon',
                              'whale',
                              'bear',
                              'lizard',
                              'Tortoise'
                           ]; 
                           
                           let swimmers = animals.slice(0,3); 
                              // Shark, Salmon, whale
                           let mammals = animals.slice(2,4);
                              // "Whale", "Bear"
                           let reptiles = animals.slice(4,6) or (4)
                              // "Lizard", "Tortoise"

                  Splice
                     It removes and replaces an element in an array or it could add more elements into the array
                     Uses 3 diffrerent Variables
                        * start
                        * deleteCount
                        * Items to delete(optional)

                     Syntax Example
                     var arrDeletedItems = array.splice(start[, deleteCount[item1[,item2[etc.]]]])
                        animals.splice(1,0, 'Octopus')
                  
                  Sort
                     Sorts the elemnents of an array "in place" and returns the sorted array. The defult sort order is built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units
                        Example
                           let people = ['Mrs. Robinson', 'Angie', 'Jolene', 'Maggie May', 'Roxanne'];
                             //people.sort() "Angie", "Jolene", "Maggie May", "Mrs. Robinson", "Roxanne"
                           let nums = [34, 10, 100000, 67, 99]
                             //nums.sort [10, 100000, 34, 67, 99]

                        Because the defult sort converts everything into a "string" it numbers based on there UTF-16 codes.

      Reference Types
         Variables that store primitive type contain values stored in memory.
         Arrays are stored in reference to it's memory.

   
   Const & Arrays
       You can change the value in a const element using arrays because your not changing the actual value of the Variable, but changing the reference of said Variable.
         Example
            const myEggs = ['brown', 'brown'];
               const myEggs --> Can not be changed, however the data in the arrays can.
                myEggs.push('purple');
                myEggs[0] = 'green';
         You can not change the values in the array directly.
            Example
               myEggs = ['blue', 'pink']; // Will not work due to change the values directly.
   
   Nested Arrays
      Nested arrays are like nested strings. you can stack arrays inside arrays, inside arrays.
         Example
            const colors = [
               ['red', 'crimson'],
               ['orange', 'dark orange'],
               ['yellow', 'golden rod'],
               ['green', 'olive'],
               ['blue', 'navy blue']
               ['purple', 'orchid']
            ]
            
         Arrays are indexed like strings so calling [2] will give the second (3rd) array in the index
            Example
               colors[2] // Will return ["yellow", "golden rod"]
         You can further add indexes to search not just the array, but also whats in the array.
            Example
               colors[2] [0] // Will return ["yellow"] 
         In you change the Variable inside the array by using the previous command
               colors[2] [0] = 'gold'
                  colors[2] // will retrun [ "gold, "golden rod"]
         
         Tick Tack Toe board Example
            const board = [
               ['0', null, 'X']
               [null, 'X'. '0']
               ['X', '0', null]
            ]


Objects
   An object allows the use to store data in groups in specified labels.
      Example of an object
         const fitbitData {
            totalSteps        : 308727,
            totalMiles        : 211.7,
            avgCalorieBurn    : 5755,
            workoutsThisWeek  :'5 of 7',
            avgGoodSleep      :'2:13;
         };
   Objects are collections of properties.
   properties are a "key-value' pair
   Rather than accessing data with the index , objects allow the use of custom keys.

   Object literal Syntax uses curly braces {}
      Syntax to get isolated objected data 
         fitbitData.totalSteps // Will return 308727.
   All keys will be converted to strings in an object.

   You can sort of use numbers as a key for an object, however you won't be able to navigate to them in console. 
      Example
         const num = {
            100      : 'one hundred'
            16       : 'sixteen'
         }
      num.16 // will result in a syntax errors
      num.[16] // will return with "sixteen"

   If using square brackets with words then they must be in quotes
      Example
         const palette = {
            red    : '#eb4d4b',
            yellow : '#f9ca24',
            blue   : '#30336b'
         }
      //const[red] will not run, but const['red'] will

   Nested Objects and arrays

      Example
         const student = {
            firstName   :'David',
            lastName    :'Jones',
            strengths   : ['Music', 'Art' ],
            Exams       :{
               midterm  :92,
               final    :88
            }
         }

   const avg = (student.exams.midterm + student.exams.final) /2;

      shoppingList Example
         const shoppingCart = [
            {
               product  : 'Jenga Classic',
               price    :  6.88,
               quantity :  1
            },
            {
               product  : 'Echo Dot',
               price    :  29.99,
               quantity :  3
            },
            {
               product  : 'Fire Stick',
               price    :  39.99,
               quantity :  2
            }
         ];

   Objects and reference types
      Example
         let nums = [1,2,3];
         let mystery = [1,2,3];
            nums === mystery // results in False |  They are different Variables with different memory references 
            nums == mystery // results in False  |  They are different Variables with different memory references
         
      Furher Example
         const user = {
            username      : 'CherryGarcia8',
            email         : 'garcia@gmail.com',
            notifications :  []
         };

            if (user.notifications === []) {
               console.log(('NO NEW NOTIFICATIONS!');
            } // This will not run because [] is saved under a different memory from {notifications : [] }

            if user.notifications.length === 0 {
               console.log ('NO NEW NOTIFICATIONS!');  // Will work because it reference the object property in meemory.
            }

Loops
   Goals 
      * Write for loops
      * Write while loops
      * Avoid infinite loops!
      * Iterate over arrays and objects

   Loops allow for the repeating of  code 
      // Print 'hello World!' 10 totalMiles
      // sum all numbers in an array

   The types of loops:
      * for loop
      * while loop
      * for ...of loop
      * for ...in loop
      
   for loop syntax
      for(
         [initalExpression];
         [condition];
         [incrementExpression]
      )
         Example
            for (let i = 1; i <=10; i++);

   You can loop arrays and strings
      const animals = [ 'lions', 'tigers', 'bears' ];
         for(let i= 0; i < animals.length; i++) {
            console.log(i, animals[i]);
         }
      const examScores = [ 98, 77, 84, 91, 57, 66];
         for(let i = 0; i <= examScores.length; i++)
      
      const myStudents = [
         {
            firstName : 'Zeus',
            grade     : 86
         }
         {
            firstName : 'Artemis',
            grade     : 97
         }
         {
            firstName : 'Hera',
            grade     : 72
         }
         {
            firstName : 'Apollo',
            grade     : 90
         }
      ]

         for(let i =  0; i < myStudents.length; i++){
            let student = myStudents[i]
            console.log(`${student.firstName} Scored ${student.grade}`);
         }

   Nested Loops
    Example
      for(let i=1; i <= 10; i++) {
         console.log('Outer Loop:', i);
         for(let j = 10, j>=10; j-=2){
            console.log(' Inner Loop',j)
         }
      }

   While loop 
      A while loop will run continously as long as it's tested condition is = True
         Example 
            let j = 0;
               while (j <= 10) {
                  console.log(j);
                  j++;
               }

            const target = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10); {
                console.log("Target", target);
            }
            let guess = Math.floor(Math.random() * 10);
               while(guess !== target) {
                  console.log("Guess", guess);
                  guess =  Math.floor(Math.random() *10)
            };

            console.log(`Target: ${target} Guess: ${guess}`);
            console.log(`You Guessed It correctedly`)
   
   breaking loops
      for(let i=0; i< 10; i++) {
         console.log(i);
         if (i === 5) {
            break;
         }
      }

   FOR of (not supported by internet explorer)
      A easier way of iterating over arrays
         for (variable of iterable) {
            statement
         }
      
      Example
         let subreddits - ['soccor', 'popheads', 'cringe', 'books'];
            for(let i= 0; <subreddits.length; i++){
               console.log(subreddits;[i]);
            }
         
      With 'FOR OF'
         for( let sub of subreddits) {
            console.log(sub)
         }
         const words1 = [ 'mail','milk','bath','black'];
         const words2 = [ 'box','shake','tub','berry' ];
            for(let i = 0; i < words1.length; i++) {
               console.log(`${words1[i]}${words2[i]}`)

   Looping over objects
      Example
         const movieReviews = {
            'Arrival'              : 9.5,
            'Alien'                : 9,
            'Amelie'               : 8,
            'In Bruges'            : 9,
            'Amadeus'              : 10,
            'Kill Bill'            : 8,
            'Little Miss Sunshine' : 8.5,
            'Coraline              : 7.5
         };
      You can't loop an object, however you can loop either the keys or the values (Key:Value)

Functions
   Goals
      * Write valid functions
      * Write functions with arguments
      * Compare function expressions & function statements
      * Write a bunch of functions

   A function allows  us to write reusable, modular code.
   We define a "chunk" of code that we can execute at a later point

      Syntax Example
         function functionName() {
            //do something
         }

         function grumpus() {
            console.log('ugh...you again...');
            console.log('FOR THE LAST TIME...');
            console.log('LEAVE ME ALONE!!!');
         }

      Looped Example
         for(let i=0; i < 50; i++) {
            grumpus();
         }
      
      Dice Example
         funtion rollDice() {
            let roll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) +1;
            console.log(`Rolled: ${roll}`);
         }

         function throwDice() {
            rollDice()
            rollDice()
            rollDice()
            rollDice()
            rollDice()
         }
         
   Function arguments
      An argument is an acceptable input that can be used to call a function

      Argument Example
         function greet(nickname){
            console.log(`Hello ${nickname}, Welcome back`)
         }
         //running greet('Tim') will run -- "Hello Tim, Welcome back"

      Loop Example
         function throwDice(numRolls) {
            for(let i = 1; i < numRolls; i++) {
               rollDice();
            }
         }
   Mutiable Functions 
      function sum(x, y) {
         console.log(x + y);
      }

      function divide(a,b) {
         console.log(a / b);
      }
       // divide (1,4)
          // retuns 0.25
       // divide (4,1)
          // returns 4

      The order of matters when passing mutiple arguments

   Return
      Built in methods return values when called upon. The values can be stored
      You can capture a return in a variable

         function add(x, y) {
            return x + y; 
         }

         const sum = add(10, 16);
         sum; // 26

         const answer = add(100, 200);
         answer; //300
      
      You can not return more than 1 thing, but you can have mutiple return statements

      Return statements ends function execution and specifies the value that is returned by the function

         function isPurple(color)
            if(color === 'purple'){
               return true;
            }  
            else {
               console.log('Try again')
               return false;
            }

            function isPurple(color) {
               return color.toLowerCase() === 'purple';
            }
            function containsPurple(arr) {
               for (let color of arr) {
                  if (color === 'purple' || color === 'magenta') {
                     return true;
                  }
               }
               return false;
            }
