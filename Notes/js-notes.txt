====================================================


JS Building Blocks
    Values & Variables

Goals 
 Working with primitive types
    * Number
    * String
    * Boolean
    * Null
    * Undefined

 Understand let & const

 Use String Template Literals

 Work with common operators / methods

 To make comments use `//`

====================================================

Primitive Types
    * Number
       Numeraic Value
    * String
       Text in quotation marks
    * Boolean
       True or False values
    * Null
    * Undefined
    * Symbol
    * BigInt
       
Primitive Type -> Numbers
   A way of storing or repersenting a number in Javascript.
   Number function allows 
      Postive,
      Negitive,
      Whole (intergers)
      & Decimal Numbers
   
   Opperators
      Additon, (+)
      Subtraction, (-)
      Division, (-)
      Mutiplaction, (*)
      Modulo, (%)
      Exponents, (**)

   N a N ( Not  A Number)
    0/0 = NaN
    1 + NaN = NaN
   
Variables & let
   Variables  act like a labeled jar
     Stores a value and a name so you can;
        * Recall it
        * Use it
        * Change it later   
           
   Basic Syntax // let someName = 'value';

   To Update Value(s)
     [ 'someName' + 'someName' = 'Value' ]

   shorthand version
     [ 'someName' += 'Value' ] 
   
   Can not use Variables with lexically bound names or declared identifiers
      Use detailed  names rather than simple characters
   You can not start a Variables with a numerical digit

   Camocase -> When naming this with many words don't capitalize first word but capitalize words that come after the first 
      Ex ( let someName or let someBodyIUseToKnow )

   Unary Variables

      (++) will add 1 to Variables
      (--) Will deduct 1 from Variables

Constant
   Basic Syntax
      (const 'someName' = 4)

   const works like let except you can not change the value

VAR 
   Prior to let and const var was the only way to declare a Variable. 

   Example Syntax
      ( var eggs = 12)
   ** slight difference between var and let, not mentioned yet but has to do with scope*

Booleans
   True or False values

Strings
   Values that use Text
   Must use either ' or " and wrap text But you can't mix and match

   Strings are indexed, meaning that each character has a positional number The first character of a string will always be at position '0' and will count up from 0 
      [ For Ex. "Chicken" = '0123456' ]

   Strings have a 'length' property that will count characters
      [ "hello".length =an output '5' ]
   
   Putting brackets around index will call for the repersenting postion's character
      { hello [3] = 'l' }

   Strings are immudable and can not be changed

   Some string methods accept arguments that modify the string's behavior. These arguments should be inside (parentheses)

      Explaining stringMethod.indexOf using example string [ let tvShow = 'catdog' ;]
         tvShow.indexOf('cat') will result in 0
         tvShow.indexOf('dog') will result in 3
         tvShow.indexOf ('z')  will result in -1 (not found)

            This method search for which value the search starts at. for example 'cat' is the start of the sting. And 'dog' starts at 3 because thats when it falls in the index.

               If there are more than one letter or reference you will get the first character found

               If there is no value found in the search it will result in -1 

      Explaining stringMethod.slice using example string [ let str = 'supercalifragilisticeexpialidocious'] 
         str.slice(0,5); will result in 'super'
         str.slice(5);   will result in 'califragilisticexpialidocious'

   REPL
      R read
      E evaluate
      P print
      L loop
         
   use [ console.log() ] 
         
   String Escapes
      \n - * Newline   
      \' - * Single quote
      \" - * Double Quote
      \\ - * Backslash
   
      Example of double Quote
         "He said \"I ain't happy\""
            Results in [ He said "I ain't happy" ]
               Using the Backslash {\} before the quote tells Javascript that the quotes after the Backslash are apart of the string, not the end of a string. The same applies for Single quotes. 
   
      Example,  
         'Jacob isn\'t happy'
            Results in [ Jacob isn't happy ]
   
   String Template Literals
      Template literals are strings that allow embedded expressions. The expressions will be evaluated and turned into a proper string. 
      
      Must use the back-tick in order to Template literals (`)

         Example [ `I counted ${3 + 4} sheep` // will result in "I countd 7 sheep ]
   
            Further Examples
               let item      = 'cucumbers';
               let price     = 1.99;
               let quantity  = 4;
                  `You bought ${quantity} ${item}, Total Price: $${price*quantity}`;
                     // Results in [ "You bought 4 cucumbers, Total Price: $7.96" ]
   
               const minAge =21;
               let yourAge  =19;
                  `You must be ${minAge} to enter. Come back in ${minAge - yourAge} years!`
                     // Results in [ "You mustt be 21 to enter. Come back in 2 years!" ]

Null
   Intentional absence of any value
   Must be Assigned
      Example [ let loggedInUser = null; ]
         This tells Javascript that the value is nothing  / not assigned yet

Undefined
   Variables that do not have an Assigned value and are Undefined

Math Object 
   Contains properties and methods for mathmatical constants and functions
      // Examples of math objects
         Pi 
            Math.PI             // 3.141592653589793

         Rounding a number
            Math.round(4.9)     //5

         Absolute Values
            Math.abs(-456)      //456

         Raises # to the #'s power
            Math.pow(2,5)       //32

         Removes Decimal
            Math.floor(3.99999) //3

   Random Numbers
      Math.random()  gives us a random Decimal between 0 and 1 (non-inclusive)

         Example of Math.random

            const step1 = Math.random();
               //0.561104892810127

            const step2 = step1 * 10
               //5.561104892810127
            
            const step 3 = Math.floor(step2);
               //5
            
            const step 4 = step3 + 1;
               //6

         Shorthand Example
            [ Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1 ]
               //6

parseInt & parseFloat

   Turns strings into numbers. (can cause NaN errors)
      Examples
         parseInt('24')          //24
         parseInt('24.987')      //24
         parseInt('28dayslater') //28   
   
         parseFloat('24.987')          //24.987
         parseFloat('7')               //7
         parseFloat('I ate 3 shrimp)   //NaN

      Returns NaN if there is a character prior to a number

Conditional Logic
   Goals
      * Understand Comparison Operators
      * Write Conditionals
      * Work with Boolean Operators


   Comparison Operators [ Defults to returning a Boolean ]

         >   // Greater than 
         <   // Less than
         >=  // Greater than or equal to
         <=  // Less than or equal to 

         ==  // equalality
         !=  // Not equal
         === // Strict Equality
         !== // Strict non-equalality

   Most Comparisons are made to compare numbers, however, You can compare strings. When using special characters, accents, and cases they can get "dicey".
   When comparing strings 'Unicode' identifiers will determine strings Comparisons

   == vs === ( Equality vs Strict Equality)

      == ( Double Equals )
         Checks equalality of a value, but not equalality of types
         It coerces both values to the same type and then compares them
         May lead to unexpected Results
      
      === ( Triple Equals )
         Checks for both values and types

      != is the same has ==     But    it checks if the values are not the same

      !== is the same has ===   But    it checks if values & types are not the same

   Conditional Statements 
      There are 3 types of conditionals statements
         If
         ELSE IF
         ELSE

      IF
         Runs designated code if a condition is marked as 'TRUE' 

      ELSE IF
          A follow up condition if the first 'IF' condtion was not met. 

      ELSE
         Runs if there 'IF' and 'ELSE IF' did not return a value. 
         Does not need a conditional argument.  Requires an 'IF' statement, but not an 'ELSE IF'

   Nesting
      Nesting is the stacking of several layers of conditionals in a given statement.

   Truthy & Falsy Values
      All values have an inherent truthy or falsy boolean value
         Values considered 'Falsy'
            * False
            * 0
            * "" (Empty string)
            * Null
            * Undefined
            * NaN
         All other values are considered truthy

   Logical Operators
      List of Logical Operators
         * &&   And 
                     compares values has true and if both sides are not true then it will return has false

         * ||   OR
                  compares if one side is true or false, if one side is the same it is returned has true

         * !   NOT
                  Returns 'TRUE' if the given value is considered 'FALSE'

   Operators Precident
      Precident Ranking
         NOT (!)   has a higher precedence than && and ||
         &&  (AND) has a higher precedence than ||
         ||  (OR)  has the lowest precedence

      Logic Example
         ``` let x = 7
             x==7 || x===3 && x > 10;```
               Result : 'TRUE'
         Reason:
            Sense the (&&) Operators has precedence over the (||) operator the script runs (&&) first. 
            (x === 3 && x > 10) x == 7

   Switch Value Example 
      ``` switch  (day) { 
         case1:
            console.log("Monday");
         case2:
            console.log("Tuesday");
         case3:
            console.log("Wednesday");
         case4:
            console.log("Thursday");
         case5:
            console.log("Friday");
         case6:
            console.log("Saturday");
         case7:
            console.log("Sunday");
      } ```

      Adding a 'break;' to the will run only the case(#) that the script is looking for
         
         ``` switch  (day) { 
            case1:
               console.log("Monday");
                  break;
            case2:
               console.log("Tuesday");
                  break;
            case3:
               console.log("Wednesday");
                  break;
            case4:
               console.log("Thursday");
                  break;
            case5:
               console.log("Friday");
                  break;
            case6:
               console.log("Saturday");
                  break;
            case7:
               console.log("Sunday");
                  break;
         } ```

Ternary Operator
   Is a "shortcut index" it takes an 'IF' and an 'ELSE' and making them a single line of code
   
   Follows (3) arguments [ condition ? expIfTrue: expIfFalse ]
      Example
         let num  =7;
      
         if(num === 7) {
            console.log("lucky!")
         }
         else {
            console.log("BAD!");
         }
      Example w/ Ternary shorthand
         num === 7 ? console.log("lucky"): console.log("BAD!");

      Example using Variable
         let status = 'offline';
         let color;
            if (status === 'offline') {
               color ='red';
            }
            else {
               color = 'green';
            }
      Variable Example w/ shorthand
          let color = status ==='offline' ? ''red' : 'green';
